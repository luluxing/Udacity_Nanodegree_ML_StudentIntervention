    "**Answer: **Appropriate supervised learning techniques are decision tree, support vector machine and naive Bayes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general application of decision tree is in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning (From wikipedia). \n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness: it is prone to overfitting and may become very complex. From manual pages of sklearn: decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated; the problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement; there are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems; decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "The strength: it is easy to interpret; ensemble methods can be built based on decision trees. From manual pages of sklearn: decision tree requires little data preparation; the cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree; it is able to handle both numerical and categorical data; it is able to handle multi-output problems; it uses a white box model; it is possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model; it performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choosing decision tree: Given the data, there are some features that are tightly correlated with the target such as the study time, romantic, absences and so on. And based on these features a decision tree can be built with a relatively large infomation gain and a good interpretation. Also, little data preparation is needed for decision trees.\n",
    " \n",
    "The general applications of support vector machine include text categorization, classification of images, hand-written characters recognization and biological and other sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness: SVMs don't work well with large datasets and lots of noise. It is slow and choosing an approapriate kernel requires effort. From manual pages of sklearn: If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances; SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength: SVMs can turn a high dimensional problem into a low dimensional problem. From manual pages of sklearn: Effective in high dimensional spaces; still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples; it uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient; it is versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choosing SVM: There are 30 features of the data, so the relationship among them may be quite complex. SVMs provide great tool for analyzing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general applications of naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. It was introduced under a different name into the text retrieval community in the early 1960s and remains a popular (baseline) method for text categorization, the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as the features. It also finds application in automatic medical diagnosis (From wikipedia).\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness: it is based on probability theory and sometimes the model is too simple to predict the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength: it only requires a small amount of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification. The model is simple and the running time is very short because all it has to do is just counting datapoints. When there are lots of noise in the data and the classes are very overlapping, it is better to use naive Bayes than more advanced SVM methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason for choosing naive Bayes: It is another simple method to do classification. Because there are as many as 30 possible features in the data, so a fast method is needed and naive Bayes is simple and fast."

    "**Answer: **I will choose SVM classifier as the best model. Firstly, desicion tree model has a relatively lower F1 score compared to the SVM classifier. From the F1 scores of the training data, which are all ones, the decision tree model is very likely to be overfitting of the training datapoints. Although the training time is a little smaller than that of the SVM, it doesn't make big differences because the overall time is quite small.Secondly, Gaussian NB model does poorly when the training data size is small. Even after the training data size increases, the F1 scores of the testing data are still smaller than those of SVM classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, when there are not enough training data (when the training size is 100), SVM is the best at predicting the testing data with the highest F1 scores. If all the training points are used (when the training size is 300), SVM is still the best with the highest F1 scores. So the overall predicting ability of SVM is the best. The F1 score of SVM doesn't change much when the training size is increasing so this model is robust. However, the time it takes to train a SVM model is longer than that of decision tree and naive Bayes. But considering the overall time is less than one second, the tiny differences among them can be ignored."

   "source": [
    "**Answer: **The final model I choose is called support vector machine. I chose it because it does best among all the other models including decision tree and naive Bayes classifier. The name of support vector machine may seem weird, at least to me at first glance. You may imagine it to be a machine which requires the support vectors to participate. I will refer to it as SVM to minimize the incomfort raised by this techical term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically what SVM does is to separate data. In our example, we aim to divide the students into two groups: the intervention-needed group and no intervention group. So we need to first build a predicting system based on the data we have. We collected the data of 395 students and all the backgroung information about them including age, study time, free time, parent jobs and so on. All of these are factors we think may contribute to the students' performane at school. We first transformed the data to numbers so that computers could understand and do the calculations and different numbers have different meanings. Then we chose from the data (~25%) randomly a small subset to test our predicting system before it is put into real use. We performed SVM on the 75% of the data. The computer separates the data based on whether the students passed or not. And the computer separates as best as it can to maximize the differences between these two groups of students. Imagine drawing a line between two groups of points. We want the line to be as far as it can from both groups. And SVM can find this line and try to minimize the number of the points in the transition zone between two groups. The less points fell in the transition zone the better the data is separated. However because there are many different attibutes we need to take into consideration, we cannot draw a simple line to separate the data, then we let SVM do a little trick behind the screen. This is just like taking a ball and projecting it to a plane. So the 3-D ball becomes a 2-D circle and we can do easier math on circles. This trick is particularly useful when dealing these large number of attributes. After SVM has built a model based on the data, we need to test it on the remaining data it has never seen. It has a high prediction accuracy even when trained with only 100 datapoints. So SVM proves to be a good model in the prediction system."
